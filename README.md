# Legaltestation

## Problem Statement: A Basic IRL Notary Platform

For simplicity, let's assume that Bob needs to sign a contract physically and needs the signature notarized by a second person, Alice. With digital signatures, anybody can validate the signature using public keys, but for signatures in real life, this cannot be easily done. How can we be sure that Bob signed instead of another person forging his signature? Enter Alice, a trusted notary. Alice's whole job is centered around attesting that the person signing a contract is who they say they are. If people know they can trust Alice, they know that Bob did indeed sign the contract if Alice says so. We will implement a system where Alice can attest Bob's signature using attestations on Sign Protocol.


# Frontend Template

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
